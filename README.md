## Overview

### The challenge

Hi everyone. My React version of this challenge. Because of the bug in the map library for React, I have to rerender the Map component for each search. But it was the best way to resolve. Also, I added some regexp mess to validate the searching request string. GEO API can take only strings without https:// and '//' symbols.

I'll be glad to see your feedback and a more elegant way to cope with it. I'm a beginner :))

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
